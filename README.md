### Frontend

A minimal Angular frontend is included with a login view only. It connects to the backend via CORS.

To run it:

```bash
cd ticket-frontend
npm install
ng serve
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:4200/`.

**Note**: Only the login functionality is implemented. The app expects the backend running at `http://localhost:8000/`.
